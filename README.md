Instructions for how to run:

If you try to run this without the dataset structured in the way the submission has the folders structured, it will not run. 
This is because of some strange behavior I (Donovan) found with the datasets.load_files function. 
If pointed at a folder which directly contained files (IE: the subfolders of the BBC folder), it would not load any files. 
If it was pointed at a folder with a subfolder that contained the output files, everything would load as normal. 
To avoid impacting Julien's solution for task 1, I simply included each subfolder with another subfolder within it at the root of the solution such that 

business/[anyfolder]/001.txt would be a valid relative path.

Our submission should have all the files structured in the correct way so the solution can run without any issues.

BBC/business/001.txt should also be a valid relative path. (Both are necessary).

drug200.csv should be a valid relative path.

1) The file 'task 1 and 2 graphs and counting.py' contains sections f) - k) from part 7 of Task 1 as well as the distribution graphs from task 1 and 2.
2) Task 1 is primarily located in a Juptyer notebook file 'Task1.ipynb'. 
There are a few missing sections to do with counting numbers. These are handled by the aforementioned file.
3) Task 2 is primarily located in the python file: 'Task2.py'.

Assuming the above file structure is correct, each of the files should be able to run.
